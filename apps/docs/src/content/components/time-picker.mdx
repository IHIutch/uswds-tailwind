## Progressive Enhancement
Because this component heavily relies on Javascript, in environments where Javascript isn't present or hasn't yet loaded, this component falls back to the native `<select>` element. When Javascript is loaded, the `<select>` element will be hidden and all options will be passed to the **Combobox** component.

This ensures that users will always be able to interact with a functional component regardless of their connectivity or browser settings.
