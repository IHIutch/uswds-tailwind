## Accessibility

- Use a `<ul>` to surround a card group and a `<li>` for each card within. This formatting allows screen readers to enumerate the items in the card group and allows shortcuts between list items.

- Use the appropriate heading level for your page. Update heading level based on the content of your page to make sure card headings are in the correct, logical outline order.
