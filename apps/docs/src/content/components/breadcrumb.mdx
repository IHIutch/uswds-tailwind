import ComponentPreview from '#components/component-preview.astro'

## Usage

A breadcrumb bar shows the location of the current page in the site structure. It’s like a path from the current page back to the home page, showing each level of organization in-between. Breadcrumbs allow a user to navigate “up” to a parent section instead of “Back” to the previous page. Use breadcrumbs to help users navigate and understand the organization of your site.

## Examples

### Default

<ComponentPreview title="Breadcumb Default" component="breadcrumb" variant="breadcrumb" />

### Wrapping 

<ComponentPreview title="Breadcrumb Wrapping" component="breadcrumb" variant="breadcrumb-wrapping" />
