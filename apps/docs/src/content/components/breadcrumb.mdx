## Usage

A breadcrumb shows the location of the current page in the site structure. It's like a path from the current page back to the home page, showing each level of organization in-between. Breadcrumbs allow a user to navigate “up” to a parent section instead of “Back” to the previous page. Use breadcrumbs to help users navigate and understand the organization of your site.

## Examples

### Default

<ComponentPreview title="Breadcumb Default" component="breadcrumb" variant="breadcrumb" />

### Wrapping 

<ComponentPreview title="Breadcrumb Wrapping" component="breadcrumb" variant="breadcrumb-wrapping" />

## Component API

Breadcrumbs are made up of the following elements:

### Root

<ContentList>
  - #### `<nav>`
    
    Use a `<nav>` as the root element. This allows assistive technology to present the **breadcrumbs** in context as a navigational element on the page.

  - #### `aria-label`

    **Default:** `'Breadcrumb'`
    
    Provide a label that describes the type of navigation provided in the nav element. 
</ContentList>

### List

<ContentList>
  - #### `<ol>`
    
    Use an `<ol>` for breadcrumb **lists**. This allows assistive technology to enumerate the items in the **breadcrumbs** and allows shortcuts between list items.

</ContentList>

### List Item

<ContentList>
  - #### `<li>`
    
    Use an `<li>` for breadcrumb **list items**. This allows assistive technology to enumerate the items in the **breadcrumbs** and allows shortcuts between list items.

</ContentList>

### Link

<ContentList>
  - #### `<a>` or `<span>`

    Use an `<a>` element when breadcrumb items are clickable. Every item, except for the **current page** (in our case the *last* item), represented in the breadcrumb should use an `<a>` element. 
    
    Use a `<span>` for the item in a breadcrumb represents the **current page**. This element is not clickable. Combine this element with the attributes below to create an accessible "current page" breadcrumb item.

  - #### `role="link"`
    
    Allows screen readers to communicate the breadcrumb item as if it were a link.

    **Only use on the "current page" breadcrumb item.**

  - #### `aria-current="page"`
    
    Allows screen readers to communicate that the element represents the current page.

    **Only use on the "current page" breadcrumb item.**

  - #### `aria-disabled="true"`
    
    Allows screen readers to communicate that the element is not clickable.

    **Only use on the "current page" breadcrumb item.**

</ContentList>

### Seperator

<ContentList>
  - #### `aria-hidden="true"`
    
    Hide **separators** from screen readers by using `aria-hidden="true"`. **Separators** between **breadcrumb items** should not be read by screen readers.

</ContentList>

## Accessibility

- Like text, **separators** must have at least have a contrast ratio of **4.5:1** (WCAG AA) against their background.
