## Usage

A breadcrumb shows the location of the current page in the site structure. It's like a path from the current page back to the home page, showing each level of organization in-between. Breadcrumbs allow a user to navigate “up” to a parent section instead of “Back” to the previous page. Use breadcrumbs to help users navigate and understand the organization of your site.

## Examples

### Default

<ComponentPreview title="Breadcumb Default" component="breadcrumb" variant="breadcrumb" />

## Variants

### Wrapping 

<ComponentPreview title="Breadcrumb Wrapping" component="breadcrumb" variant="breadcrumb-wrapping" />

## Anatomy

Breadcrumbs are made up of 4 primary elements:

- Root
- Breadcrumb List
- Breadcrumb Item
- Separator

## Accessibility

- Use `<nav>` as as the root element. This allows assistive technology to present the **breadcrumbs** in context as a navigational element on the page.
- Use ordered lists and list items. Use an `<ol>` for **breadcrumb lists** and an `<li>` for each **breadcrumb item**. This allows assistive technology to enumerate the items in the **breadcrumbs** and allows shortcuts between list items.
- Use ARIA markup for additional context. Use `aria-label="Breadcrumbs"` on the root element and `aria-current="page"` on the **breadcrumb item** that represents the current page (typically the last item of the list).
- Like text, **separators** must have at least have a contrast ratio of **4.5:1** (WCAG AA) against their background.
- Hide **separators** from screen readers by using `aria-hidden="true"`. **Separators** between **breadcrumb items** should not be read by screen readers.
