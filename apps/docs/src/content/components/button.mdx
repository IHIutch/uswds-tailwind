import ComponentPreview from '#components/component-preview.astro'

## Examples

<ComponentPreview title="Buttons" component="button" variant="button" />

## Accessibility

- Don't rely on color alone to communicate the intention of a button. Assistive technologies, such as screen readers, will not be able to convey this information. 

  Ensure the intention is obvious from the contents of the button itself.
