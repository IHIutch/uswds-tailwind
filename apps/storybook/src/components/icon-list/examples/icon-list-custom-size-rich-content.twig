    <div>
      <h3 class="font-bold font-merriweather text-lg pt-0.5">Let the sun shine.</h3>
      <p class="mt-2">On sunny days, open your curtains to allow the sun to naturally warm the rooms of your home without using electricity. Natural sunlight can also lift your mood to help brighten your day. On warm days, close your curtains to help keep your house cool.</p>

    <div>
      <h3 class="font-bold font-merriweather text-lg pt-0.5">Adjust your schedule.</h3>
      <p class="mt-2">Instead of running high-energy-use appliances such as dishwashers and clothes dryers during mid-afternoon or early evening hours, operate them early in the morning or late at night. Some utilities charge less at off-peak times, which will help reduce your costs.</p>

    <div class="icon-[material-symbols--attach-money] size-8 text-green-50v shrink-0"></div>
    <div>
      <h3 class="font-bold font-merriweather text-lg pt-0.5">Fill it up.</h3>
      <p class="mt-2">Wash full loads, whether it’s clothes or dishes. Washing multiple small loads means you’re using and heating more water, which can increase your expenses. Using cold water for clothes washing can also help lower your costs.</p>
